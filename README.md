# react-native-blog
react native app that manages blog posts

This app uses react-native-json-server to store the blog posts.
You need to configure the url of this json server. 

To do that

- open and run react-native-json-server with ngrok (read its doc)
- copy and past the forwarding url genereated by ngrok into ./src/api/jsonServer.js
